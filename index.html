This creates a requirement for access to some personal information and data, which can be a touchy subject for a lot of people.<br><br>Because Whether is a free service, created for academic purposes, we have no requirement or desire to make money, and have no use for provided information about our users. To put it bluntly, we don’t care what your name is, where you are, or what’s on your calendar. That’s your business, not ours.<br><br>To help keep you feeling safe and keep your data private. we don’t call it back. We don’t see your location, your calendar, even your name or any other information you might supply through normal use of our service. It’s not sent back to us, but managed locally and through our third party providers. We don’t have searches, or cookies, or other stored or tracked data. No ads, no targeted marketing, and no desire or use for retaining any personal information.<br><br>We use Google’s APIs to access data you have already given them. We don’t see it, it stays strictly between Google and you locally. Your name and calendar are never visible to us. We use a Google Maps API to determine your location; as such your geolocation coordinates are called back to them. You can view Google’s extensive Privacy Policies here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.<br><br>Your location is also shared with OpenWeatherMap, who provide the APIs and information about your weather we need to run this service. Unfortunately for super privacy conscious folk out there (hi, Walter!) we really do need at least your location to work.<br><br>Location information is kept wholly anonymous, it is sent in a simple, non-unique manner to our API providers and partners. Even to Google, your coordinates are sent independently of your account requests.<br><br>If we are legally compelled to provide user data, we shall of course comply to the extent we feel is requested and absolutely necessary; however we retain limited data of use to law enforcement.<br><br>We believe that personalised delivery of information is the future, and trust should not be a consideration or concern for users to access this vision. It should be an unconscious expectation that is never challenged by a service. Whether is proud to spearhead this future of safe, carefree, personal services.<br><br>For further information and to query any element of this policy, please use the Support link at the bottom of any page.
